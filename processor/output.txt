Introducing Zero-Bundle-Size React Server Components – ReactReactv18.3.1Search⌘CtrlKLearnReferenceCommunityBlogBlogIntroducing Zero-Bundle-Size React Server ComponentsDecember 21, 2020 by Dan Abramov, Lauren Tan, Joseph Savona, and Sebastian Markbåge

2020 has been a long year. As it comes to an end we wanted to share a special Holiday Update on our research into zero-bundle-size React Server Components.

To introduce React Server Components, we have prepared a talk and a demo. If you want, you can check them out during the holidays, or later when work picks back up in the new year.

React Server Components are still in research and development. We are sharing this work in the spirit of transparency and to get initial feedback from the React community. There will be plenty of time for that, so don’t feel like you have to catch up right now!
If you want to check them out, we recommend going in the following order:


Watch the talk to learn about React Server Components and see the demo.


Clone the demo to play with React Server Components on your computer.


Read the RFC (with FAQ at the end) for a deeper technical breakdown and to provide feedback.


We are excited to hear from you on the RFC or in replies to the @reactjs Twitter handle. Happy holidays, stay safe, and see you next year!PreviousThe Plan for React 18NextOlder posts©2024no uwu plzuwu?Logo by@sawaratsuki1004Learn ReactQuick StartInstallationDescribing the UIAdding InteractivityManaging StateEscape HatchesAPI ReferenceReact APIsReact DOM APIsCommunityCode of ConductMeet the TeamDocs ContributorsAcknowledgementsMoreBlogReact NativePrivacyTerms
